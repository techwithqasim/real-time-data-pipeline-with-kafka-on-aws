# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka on AWS

This demonstrates how to build a scalable real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka and AWS services. The architecture integrates Kafka for real-time data ingestion with AWS S3, Glue, and Athena to enable efficient data storage, cataloging, and querying. The pipeline handles real-time data from CSV files, simulates streaming with Python, and processes the data seamlessly in the cloud.
